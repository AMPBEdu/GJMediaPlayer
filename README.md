# GJMediaPlayer
GJMediaPlayer (looking for better names) is a media player that will allow you to : download media from a list of URLs, play, organise, stream and sync your media across all of your devices. (IOS devices will be limited to browser streaming until an IOS app that can save media files is developed)

Goals :

1. Create a working local java media player.

2. Expand on functionality
    A. Download media from lists of URLs
    B. Create an attribution/properties editing system. Intend to use an mp3 tagging library http://id3.org/Implementations
    C. Work on flexibility in organizing music - add a playlist system, and make it easy to add songs to zero or more playlists when importing 
    D. Create a customizable shuffle system (make options to play every song once in a random order, or shuffle completely randomly etc.)

3. Create a server to sync the user's library across devices
    A. Client able to sync or just stream music from the server
    B. Add an account system, so multiple people can have different libraries on one server

4. Create an android client

5. Create an html5 website client for streaming music from a library
